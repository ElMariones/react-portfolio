## Features

This portfolio is designed to be more than just a static page. It includes a variety of dynamic and interactive features to create an engaging user experience:

* **Interactive Background:** A subtle, spotlight-like gradient effect that follows the user's mouse movements.
* **Dynamic Components:** Each section of the portfolio is a "glassmorphism" style card that animates into view.
* **Animated Hero Section:** A creative header with a 3D-tilting profile picture, a shimmering text effect for the name, and a "typing" animation for the title.
* **Gradient Glow Icons:** Social media icons feature a rotating, gradient-based glow effect on hover for a modern feel.
* **On-Page PDF Viewer:** A clean, in-page modal to view my CV without leaving the site.
* **Functional Contact Form:** A secure contact form integrated with EmailJS that provides client-side validation and clear status indicators (loading, success, error).
* **Fully Responsive:** The layout is optimized for a seamless experience on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using a modern front-end stack:

* **React:** For building the user interface with a component-based architecture.
* **Styled-Components:** For component-level styling and creating a robust design system with a theme.
* **Framer Motion:** For all animations, from simple fades to complex, physics-based interactions.
* **React-Social-Icons & React-Icons:** For clean and scalable icons.
* **EmailJS:** To power the serverless contact form.
* **Vite:** As the blazing-fast front-end build tool.

## Deployment

This portfolio is automatically deployed using **Vercel**.

The CI/CD pipeline is configured so that any `git push` to the `main` branch on GitHub will automatically trigger a new build and deployment on Vercel, ensuring the live site is always up-to-date with the latest changes.
